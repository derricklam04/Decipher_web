## About 
The Vigenere Cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text based on letter substitution and shifting.
In this full stack application, the front-end takes encoded messages from the client and passes it to the server side algorithm to be solved/decrypted. Recent queries are stored in the database and are available to be accessed again by the client. 

*For more information about the algorithm which uses letter frequency analysis, index of coincidence, and chi-square statistics, please visit the 'Learn More' page at [vigenere-code-cracker.herokuapp.com](vigenere-code-cracker.herokuapp.com/)*
